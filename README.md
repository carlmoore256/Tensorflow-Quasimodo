# Tensorflow-Quasimodo
A slightly insane way of training neural networks in real-time with live network streamed audio data

A small, unsupervised generative audio CNN is trained in real-time with audio data buffered from a low-latency JackTrip connection via Pyo and Jack. A spin on Alvin Lucier's "Quasimodo The Great Lover" (1970), this was an attempt to direct some creative energy towards a realtime audio TensorFlow pipeline for servers. It became more practical to focus on client training and inference for the scope of this project however.
